    The article below summarises the key points from the video.

<p>Malocclusion, or tooth crowding, is a common dental condition in children. There are many factors that may influence the position of adult teeth including over-retained baby teeth, and narrow jaws. However, there is a little discussed factor, and that is mouth breathing.</p>

<p>The normal way to breathe is through the nose as it allows the air to purify before entering your throat. Mouth breathing bypasses the filters in the nose, allowing harmful particles to directly reach the adenoids and tonsils.</p>

<p>The adenoids and tonsils serve as the final barrier before these particles reach your lungs. As a result, the lymphoid tissue in the adenoids and tonsils swell, making nasal breathing even more difficult.</p>

<p>Breathing through the mouth causes the tongue to sit on the floor of the mouth instead of its normal resting position on the roof of the palate. In a normal position, the tongue stimulates the widening of the palate and counteracts the pressure of the cheeks.</p>

<p>As a result, the palate becomes high and narrow, and the upper arch forms a V shape instead of an ovoid arch.</p>

<blockquote>Mouth breathing is making your childâ€™s teeth crooked. Book an appointment with your dentist to assess and correct this issue.</blockquote>
