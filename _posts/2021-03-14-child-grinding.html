<p>Teeth grinding in children during the night is quite a common occurrence. I get many parents asking if it should be a concern. Grinding can lead to worn, chipped teeth, giving a more aged appearance. It can also lead to sensitivity and pain. </p>

<span class="caption text-muted">Grinding can lead to worn, older looking teeth.</span>

<p>There are many potential causes of teeth grinding but the most common trigger is upper airway obstruction and sleep disordered breathing. This doesn’t necessarily mean your child has sleep apnoea, but it may be things like snoring or mouth breathing. </p>

<p>The second most common reason is due to low iron levels. A confounding factor is that low iron levels are also a symptom of upper airway obstruction.</p>

<p>Allergic rhinitis, or hay fever, may also cause teeth grinding. Allergic rhinitis may also lead to low iron levels and upper airway obstruction so things can get a bit muddled again. </p>

<p>Reflux or heartburn indigestion may also lead to teeth grinding at night. It is less common and children who do have reflux may not bring it up to you as the parent as they may not know it isn’t normal. This too can also lead to upper airway obstruction. </p>

<p>Tongue tie (ankyglossia) where there is increased tension in the tongue has also been known to be a trigger for teeth grinding.</p>

<p>And finally, in extremely rare circumstances, psychological triggers such as anxiety or stress may result in teeth grinding in children. However, this may be a symptom of hay fever or upper airway obstructions so should not be the first investigated cause. </p>

<p>So from most common to least:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Upper airway obstruction</li>
    <li>Low iron levels</li>
    <li>Allergic rhinitis</li>
    <li>Reflux</li>
    <li>Tongue tie</li>
    <li>Psychological issues </li>
</ol>

<p><i>Please see your dentist to get a proper diagnosis and discussion if your child is grinding as it may be a symptom of something more sinister.</i></p>
